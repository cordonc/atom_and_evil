        <p class="quote">“What is more, the diary itself is a trace of a process rather than the full representation of
            life, a trace that approximates a gap between the thoughts and experiences of the writer… And yet diaries
            are bound up with confessional discourse and the need to describe. The author of a diary may not even want
            to fully describe an event, or he or she may record an emotion for therapeutic reasons that seem true enough
            when put on paper but then disappear.” <br><br>

        <div class="diary">
            <p>(on this blog.)</p>

            <p>I realize I haven’t posted on this blog for over two years.</p>

            <p>One reason I haven’t deleted this blog is that I wanted to be able to look back and see how far I
                have come.</p>

            <p>I also look back to see if I can learn from my past mistakes.</p>

            <p>This time, while looking back at my posts on this abandoned blog-- my heart broke and I have been
                crying the most I have in a while.</p>

            <p>Something just became very clear to me and now fills me with sorrow...</p>

            <p>I realized looking back at myself, that I was inhumane.</p>

            <p>I shouldn’t have posted most of what I did. I didn’t take into account other people’s emotions or
                respect other people’s desires whatsoever. I look back and it seems extremely frightening to me now.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t want to be friends or associate with who I used to be-- I would be terrified to have any sort
                of interaction with who I was.</p>

            <p>Someone who would literally post angry and manipulative rants because he didn’t know how to deal with
                emotions and pain doesn’t seem like a chill dude to befriend in any manner.</p>

            <p>I cried this time checking this blog because it has also become apparent how scary I must have been to
                everyone I was friends with. Thinking about it now, I would have dealt with me the same way everyone who
                I was close with did. By distancing myself the fuck away from this angry timebomb and hoping he forgets
                about me before he inevitably explodes.</p>

            <p>I thought with each post I made, I was getting closer to the truth. That I was getting closer to some
                sort of ultimate realization that would help me make things better somehow.</p>

            <p>I was definitely wrong about that. Reading my posts now I realize that with each post, I actually seem
                to get further from the truth. With each post, I seem to take my emotions to a further extreme and
                irrational level that left me further and further from the actual truth.</p>

            <p>The actual truth that I was abusive and that I hurt many people I cared about with my lack of empathy
                for their feelings. That I disregarded their words and wariness towards me and aggressively demanded
                forgiveness for actions and words that I never acknowledged I had accountability or responsibility for.
            </p>

            <p>I kept asking for forgiveness while simultaneously hurting the person that I was apologizing to by
                denying their feelings and wishes and by talking to them despite their attempts to distance themselves
                from me.</p>

            <p>I realize now that all of my “apologies” were more like me trying to excuse my behavior.

            <p>I didn’t want to accept any blame for my actions or words and basically blamed them on my mental
                illness.</p>

            <p>I thought that I acted so out of character that it wasn’t me at all.</p>

            <p>But it was.</p>

            <p>The words came out of my mouth or out onto my blog. Saying that I shouldn’t take responsibility for any
                of it is absurd.</p>

            <p>It is obvious to me now that it was me the whole time no matter how you look at it. I might not have had
                the best self-control, but it was me who said all of the hurtful things and it was me who harassed my
                former friends for forgiveness. Expecting that they would be able to forgive someone who did not seem to
                think that they were accountable whatsoever. Someone that seemed to not even take into account how his
                actions and words made other people feel in the slightest. It was like I couldn’t comprehend that
                constant angry posts and messages were not making things better, and were actually making people scared
                of me.</p>

            <p>I did so many things that were erratic and extreme-- so many things that were downright hurtful and
                dismissive. Of course, people didn’t want to associate with me.</p>

            <p>And I never took responsibility for any of it, even claiming that I did without actually doing so.</p>

            <p>I have been crying because I have come to all of these realizations and I am so full of regret and
                remorse for stuff that happened years ago.</p>

            <p>I would really just like to put out an open invitation to anybody that I have hurt to message me
                somewhere (not this blog) if/when they are ready. So that I may properly apologize for my actions and
                words directly to them specifically.</p>

            <p>I post this with zero expectations of friendship or anything of the sort. I just want to properly
                apologize and take responsibility for all of my hurtful behavior.</p>

            <p>Thanks for reading.</p>

            <p>I DIDNT WANT TO TREAT YOU HORRIBLY</p>

            <p> AND I NEVER WILL DO THE SAME THINGS AGAIN.</p>

            <p>I HAVE EVALUATED AND EXAMINED MY PAST ACTIONS AND BEHAVIOR WITH THE HELP OF THERAPISTS AND GROUP THERAPY
                TO ASSURE THAT IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

            <p>EVERY TIME I WASN'T SURE ABOUT SOMETHING AND SOMETHING DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT I TOLD YOU OR I WENT TO OTHER
                PEOPLE FOR HELP.</p>

            <p>I TOLD YOU WHEN I FELT LIKE YOU WERE DOING SOMETHING TO HURT ME AND I TOLD YOU I WASN'T SURE OR CERTAIN
                WHENEVER I FELT THAT WAY AND IT HURT YOU.</p>

            <p>IT HURT YOU BECAUSE HOW COULD I THINK OR FEEL THAT WAY?!</p>

            <p>HOW COULD I?</p>

            <p>I DIDN'T KNOW EITHER.</p>

            <p>WHEN I DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT I FELT LIKE YOU WERE DOING SOMETHING TO HURT ME- IT HURT YOU BECAUSE I WASN'T
                BEING OPEN ABOUT MY FEELINGS.</p>

            <p>I JUST KNEW THAT I WAS SCARED.</p>

            <p class="bold">I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR BEING HURT BY ME. </p>

            <p>THE ONLY CERTAINTY I HAD DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME WAS FEAR.</p>

            <p>FEAR OF HURTING YOU WITH MY FEELINGS OR THOUGHTS THAT I COULDN’T CONTROL.</p>

            <p>I CANNOT POSSIBLY IMAGINE WHAT IT DID TO YOU WHENEVER I TOLD YOU THAT I FELT LIKE YOU WERE TRYING TO HURT
                ME.</p>

            <p>ACCUSATIONS LIKE THAT AND FALSE ACCUSATIONS LIKE THAT CAN EASILY BE SEEN AS ABUSIVE OR MANIPULATIVE- I
                UNDERSTAND THAT.</p>

            <p>I SWEAR ON MY LIFE THAT THESE ACCUSATIONS DID NOT COME PURPOSELY FROM ME.</p>

            <p> I DID NOT WANT TO OR WISH TO ACCUSE YOU OF ANYTHING.</p>

            <p>I DID NOT WANT TO OR WISH TO BE MANIPULATIVE AND CONTROLLING TOWARDS YOU.</p>

            <p>BECAUSE OF MY DELUSIONS I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO FEEL LIKE AND BELIEVE THAT I WAS 100% RIGHT NO MATTER WHAT
                THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO HURT ME.</p>

            <p>I KNOW IT ISN'T TRUE- AND WHEN IT WAS HAPPENING, I COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN OR HAVE BEEN CERTAIN NO MATTER
                WHAT I DID.</p>

            <p class="bold">I AM NOT TRYING TO USE DELUSIONS AS AN EXCUSE FOR MY BEHAVIOR. </p>

            <p>I AM ONLY TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED- HOPING THAT I AM NOT *BLAMED* PERSONALLY AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY
                FOR ACTING A CERTAIN WAY DUE TO A MENTAL ILLNESS.</p>

            <p>I DON'T BLAME PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS FOR BEING SCARED OR ANXIOUS OF DOING SOMETHING.</p>

            <p>I DON'T BLAME DEPRESSED PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO GET OUT OF BED OR TO NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE
                MOTIVATION TO DO ANYTHING.</p>

            <p class="bold">I DON'T BLAME DELUSIONAL PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO TELL THAT THEY ARE DELUSIONAL OR BLAME
                THEM FOR BELIEVING SOMETHING NOT BASED IN REALITY. </p>

            <p>NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY TO TELL YOU THAT I WASN'T IN CONTROL OF MY THOUGHTS OR FEELINGS DURING THIS
                PERIOD OF TIME, I STILL FEEL LIKE I AM BEING BLAMED FOR HAVING THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS THAT HAD ME
                BELIEVING THAT YOU WERE MALICIOUS TOWARDS ME.</p>

            <p>NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I TRY TO TELL YOU THAT THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU SPECIFICALLY OR
                **ANYTHING YOU ACTUALLY DID-** I CAN NEVER GET IT ACROSS BECAUSE I AM NOT THE BEST WITH WORDS.</p>

            <p>I DON'T BLAME YOU OR ANYBODY FOR MY ACTIONS. I WISH I COULD SAY I WAS IN CONTROL SO I COULD BLAME MYSELF
                PERSONALLY FOR MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AND SUBSEQUENTLY MY ACTIONS AND WORDS.</p>

            <p>I DO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE NOBODY DID OR SAID WHAT I DID BUT ME IN THE END.</p>

            <p class="bold">THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TAKING RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCEPTING BLAME. </p>

            <p>I DO NOT ACCEPT BEING BLAMED FOR SOMETHING THAT I COULDN’T CONTROL.</p>

            <p>I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND.</p>

            <p class="bold">I COULDN'T WIN AGAINST DELUSIONS. </p>

            <p>Is it my fault that I am depressed? Is it my fault that I am anxious? Is it my fault that I used to be
                delusional? No? Is it my fault that these things overcame me even though I fought back and am still
                fighting? No? If these things aren't my fault and the thoughts and feelings that go with them aren't
                either, then what can I blame me for? Acting on them? Believing my feelings were valid? Believing I was
                right because I was deluded and had no choice? Being emotionally unprepared for all of everything due to
                lack of experience and a warped reality learned from my parents? WHAT CAN I BLAME MYSELF FOR? I have
                evaluated and dissected everything I said and determined why I said these things and I can't get myself
                to 100% completely blame myself for each and every one of them. I am not blaming anybody else but me so
                don't think that while reading this. I can only think to blame my brain chemistry and my younger
                immature self for everything. Again I am also not trying to avoid responsibility. I take full
                responsibility for everything because in the end it was nobody else but me. But I do believe there is a
                difference in: 1. Taking responsibility. 2. Accepting blame. So that's the question that I am so
                confused about ultimately. What CAN I blame myself for and what more can I learn from my words and
                actions that I haven't already? What am I missing? Why is there still blame and grudge pinned on me? Why
                am I still losing friends? What am I doing wrong NOW that has nothing to do with before?</p>
