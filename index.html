        <p class="quote">“What is more, the diary itself is a trace of a process rather than the full representation of
            life, a trace that approximates a gap between the thoughts and experiences of the writer… And yet diaries
            are bound up with confessional discourse and the need to describe. The author of a diary may not even want
            to fully describe an event, or he or she may record an emotion for therapeutic reasons that seem true enough
            when put on paper but then disappear.” <br><br>

            <p class="bio">Neil was born on February 25th, 1995.</p>

            <p class="bio">Neil and I talked everyday online when we were 13 years old, but rarely spoke in class. </p>

            <p class="bio">In high school, we lost contact, and I rarely saw him on campus.</p>

            <p class="bio">We were in the graduating class of 2014. About 6 months before graduation, Neil dropped out.
                Nobody knew what happened to him.</p>

            <p class="bio">His blog posts remain published online. These are the posts leading up to the event. </p>

            <p class="bio">His last post is the first one you see when you visit the page.</p>

        <div class="diary">
            <p>(on this blog.)</p>

            <p>I realize I haven’t posted on this blog for over two years.</p>

            <p>One reason I haven’t deleted this blog is that I wanted to be able to look back and see how far I
                have come.</p>

            <p>I also look back to see if I can learn from my past mistakes.</p>

            <p>This time, while looking back at my posts on this abandoned blog-- my heart broke and I have been
                crying the most I have in a while.</p>

            <p>Something just became very clear to me and now fills me with sorrow...</p>

            <p>I realized looking back at myself, that I was inhumane.</p>

            <p>I shouldn’t have posted most of what I did. I didn’t take into account other people’s emotions or
                respect other people’s desires whatsoever. I look back and it seems extremely frightening to me now.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t want to be friends or associate with who I used to be-- I would be terrified to have any sort
                of interaction with who I was.</p>

            <p>Someone who would literally post angry and manipulative rants because he didn’t know how to deal with
                emotions and pain doesn’t seem like a chill dude to befriend in any manner.</p>

            <p>I cried this time checking this blog because it has also become apparent how scary I must have been to
                everyone I was friends with. Thinking about it now, I would have dealt with me the same way everyone who
                I was close with did. By distancing myself the fuck away from this angry timebomb and hoping he forgets
                about me before he inevitably explodes.</p>

            <p>I thought with each post I made, I was getting closer to the truth. That I was getting closer to some
                sort of ultimate realization that would help me make things better somehow.</p>

            <p>I was definitely wrong about that. Reading my posts now I realize that with each post, I actually seem
                to get further from the truth. With each post, I seem to take my emotions to a further extreme and
                irrational level that left me further and further from the actual truth.</p>

            <p>The actual truth that I was abusive and that I hurt many people I cared about with my lack of empathy
                for their feelings. That I disregarded their words and wariness towards me and aggressively demanded
                forgiveness for actions and words that I never acknowledged I had accountability or responsibility for.
            </p>

            <p>I kept asking for forgiveness while simultaneously hurting the person that I was apologizing to by
                denying their feelings and wishes and by talking to them despite their attempts to distance themselves
                from me.</p>

            <p>I realize now that all of my “apologies” were more like me trying to excuse my behavior.

            <p>I didn’t want to accept any blame for my actions or words and basically blamed them on my mental
                illness.</p>

            <p>I thought that I acted so out of character that it wasn’t me at all.</p>

            <p>But it was.</p>

            <p>The words came out of my mouth or out onto my blog. Saying that I shouldn’t take responsibility for any
                of it is absurd.</p>

            <p>It is obvious to me now that it was me the whole time no matter how you look at it. I might not have had
                the best self-control, but it was me who said all of the hurtful things and it was me who harassed my
                former friends for forgiveness. Expecting that they would be able to forgive someone who did not seem to
                think that they were accountable whatsoever. Someone that seemed to not even take into account how his
                actions and words made other people feel in the slightest. It was like I couldn’t comprehend that
                constant angry posts and messages were not making things better, and were actually making people scared
                of me.</p>

            <p>I did so many things that were erratic and extreme-- so many things that were downright hurtful and
                dismissive. Of course, people didn’t want to associate with me.</p>

            <p>And I never took responsibility for any of it, even claiming that I did without actually doing so.</p>

            <p>I have been crying because I have come to all of these realizations and I am so full of regret and
                remorse for stuff that happened years ago.</p>

            <p>I would really just like to put out an open invitation to anybody that I have hurt to message me
                somewhere (not this blog) if/when they are ready. So that I may properly apologize for my actions and
                words directly to them specifically.</p>

            <p>I post this with zero expectations of friendship or anything of the sort. I just want to properly
                apologize and take responsibility for all of my hurtful behavior.</p>

            <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
