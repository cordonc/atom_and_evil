        <p class="quote">“What is more, the diary itself is a trace of a process rather than the full representation of
            life, a trace that approximates a gap between the thoughts and experiences of the writer… And yet diaries
            are bound up with confessional discourse and the need to describe. The author of a diary may not even want
            to fully describe an event, or he or she may record an emotion for therapeutic reasons that seem true enough
            when put on paper but then disappear.” <br><br>

        <div class="diary">
            <p>(on this blog.)</p>

            <p>I realize I haven’t posted on this blog for over two years.</p>

            <p>One reason I haven’t deleted this blog is that I wanted to be able to look back and see how far I
                have come.</p>

            <p>I also look back to see if I can learn from my past mistakes.</p>

            <p>This time, while looking back at my posts on this abandoned blog-- my heart broke and I have been
                crying the most I have in a while.</p>

            <p>Something just became very clear to me and now fills me with sorrow...</p>

            <p>I realized looking back at myself, that I was inhumane.</p>

            <p>I shouldn’t have posted most of what I did. I didn’t take into account other people’s emotions or
                respect other people’s desires whatsoever. I look back and it seems extremely frightening to me now.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t want to be friends or associate with who I used to be-- I would be terrified to have any sort
                of interaction with who I was.</p>

            <p>Someone who would literally post angry and manipulative rants because he didn’t know how to deal with
                emotions and pain doesn’t seem like a chill dude to befriend in any manner.</p>

            <p>I cried this time checking this blog because it has also become apparent how scary I must have been to
                everyone I was friends with. Thinking about it now, I would have dealt with me the same way everyone who
                I was close with did. By distancing myself the fuck away from this angry timebomb and hoping he forgets
                about me before he inevitably explodes.</p>

            <p>I thought with each post I made, I was getting closer to the truth. That I was getting closer to some
                sort of ultimate realization that would help me make things better somehow.</p>

            <p>I was definitely wrong about that. Reading my posts now I realize that with each post, I actually seem
                to get further from the truth. With each post, I seem to take my emotions to a further extreme and
                irrational level that left me further and further from the actual truth.</p>

            <p>The actual truth that I was abusive and that I hurt many people I cared about with my lack of empathy
                for their feelings. That I disregarded their words and wariness towards me and aggressively demanded
                forgiveness for actions and words that I never acknowledged I had accountability or responsibility for.
            </p>

            <p>I kept asking for forgiveness while simultaneously hurting the person that I was apologizing to by
                denying their feelings and wishes and by talking to them despite their attempts to distance themselves
                from me.</p>

            <p>I realize now that all of my “apologies” were more like me trying to excuse my behavior.

            <p>I didn’t want to accept any blame for my actions or words and basically blamed them on my mental
                illness.</p>

            <p>I thought that I acted so out of character that it wasn’t me at all.</p>

            <p>But it was.</p>

            <p>The words came out of my mouth or out onto my blog. Saying that I shouldn’t take responsibility for any
                of it is absurd.</p>

            <p>It is obvious to me now that it was me the whole time no matter how you look at it. I might not have had
                the best self-control, but it was me who said all of the hurtful things and it was me who harassed my
                former friends for forgiveness. Expecting that they would be able to forgive someone who did not seem to
                think that they were accountable whatsoever. Someone that seemed to not even take into account how his
                actions and words made other people feel in the slightest. It was like I couldn’t comprehend that
                constant angry posts and messages were not making things better, and were actually making people scared
                of me.</p>

            <p>I did so many things that were erratic and extreme-- so many things that were downright hurtful and
                dismissive. Of course, people didn’t want to associate with me.</p>

            <p>And I never took responsibility for any of it, even claiming that I did without actually doing so.</p>

            <p>I have been crying because I have come to all of these realizations and I am so full of regret and
                remorse for stuff that happened years ago.</p>

            <p>I would really just like to put out an open invitation to anybody that I have hurt to message me
                somewhere (not this blog) if/when they are ready. So that I may properly apologize for my actions and
                words directly to them specifically.</p>

            <p>I post this with zero expectations of friendship or anything of the sort. I just want to properly
                apologize and take responsibility for all of my hurtful behavior.</p>

            <p>Thanks for reading.</p>

    <!--Paranoid Schizophrenia-->
    <section>
        <div class="schizo">
            <h1>Disorder Class: Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders </h1>
            <p class="schizo">A. Characteristic symptoms: Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant
                portion of time
                during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated): </p>
            <p class="schizo">1. delusions</p>
            <p class="schizo">3. disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence) </p>
            <p class="schizo">4. grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior </p>
            <p class="schizo">5. negative symptoms (i.e., affective flattening, alogia, or avolition) </p>
            <p class="schizo">Note: Only one Criterion A symptom is required if delusions are bizarre or hallucinations
                consist of a voice keeping up a running commentary on the person’s behavior or thoughts, or two or more
                voices conversing with each other. </p>
            <p class="schizo">B. Social/occupational dysfunction: For a significant portion of the time since the onset
                of the disturbance, one or more major areas of functioning such as work, interpersonal relations, or
                self-care are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in childhood or
                adolescence, failure to achieve expected level of interpersonal, academic, or occupational achievement).
            </p>
            <p class="schizo">C. Duration: Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This
                6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that meet
                Criterion A (i.e., active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms.
                During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbance may be manifested by only
                negative symptoms or two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (e.g., odd
                beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences). </p>
            <p class="schizo">D. Schizoaffective and Mood Disorder exclusion: Schizoaffective Disorder and Mood Disorder
                With Psychotic Features have been ruled out because either (1) no Major Depressive, Manic, or Mixed
                Episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms; or (2) if mood episodes have
                occurred during active-phase symptoms, their total duration has been brief relative to the duration of
                the active and residual periods. </p>
            <p class="schizo">E. Substance/general medical condition exclusion: The disturbance is not due to the direct
                physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical
                condition. </p>
            <p class="schizo">F. Relationship to a Pervasive Developmental Disorder: If there is a history of Autistic
                Disorder or another Pervasive Developmental Disorder, the additional diagnosis of Schizophrenia is made
                only if prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present for at least a month (or less if
                successfully treated). </p>
            <p class="schizo">Classification of longitudinal course (can be applied only after at least 1 year has
                elapsed since the initial onset of active-phase symptoms):

            <p>I DIDNT WANT TO TREAT YOU HORRIBLY</p>

            <p> AND I NEVER WILL DO THE SAME THINGS AGAIN.</p>

            <p>I HAVE EVALUATED AND EXAMINED MY PAST ACTIONS AND BEHAVIOR WITH THE HELP OF THERAPISTS AND GROUP THERAPY
                TO ASSURE THAT IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

            <p>EVERY TIME I WASN'T SURE ABOUT SOMETHING AND SOMETHING DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT I TOLD YOU OR I WENT TO OTHER
                PEOPLE FOR HELP.</p>

            <p>I TOLD YOU WHEN I FELT LIKE YOU WERE DOING SOMETHING TO HURT ME AND I TOLD YOU I WASN'T SURE OR CERTAIN
                WHENEVER I FELT THAT WAY AND IT HURT YOU.</p>

            <p>IT HURT YOU BECAUSE HOW COULD I THINK OR FEEL THAT WAY?!</p>

            <p>HOW COULD I?</p>

            <p>I DIDN'T KNOW EITHER.</p>

            <p>WHEN I DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT I FELT LIKE YOU WERE DOING SOMETHING TO HURT ME- IT HURT YOU BECAUSE I WASN'T
                BEING OPEN ABOUT MY FEELINGS.</p>

            <p>I JUST KNEW THAT I WAS SCARED.</p>

            <p class="bold">I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR BEING HURT BY ME. </p>

            <p>THE ONLY CERTAINTY I HAD DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME WAS FEAR.</p>

            <p>FEAR OF HURTING YOU WITH MY FEELINGS OR THOUGHTS THAT I COULDN’T CONTROL.</p>

            <p>I CANNOT POSSIBLY IMAGINE WHAT IT DID TO YOU WHENEVER I TOLD YOU THAT I FELT LIKE YOU WERE TRYING TO HURT
                ME.</p>

            <p>ACCUSATIONS LIKE THAT AND FALSE ACCUSATIONS LIKE THAT CAN EASILY BE SEEN AS ABUSIVE OR MANIPULATIVE- I
                UNDERSTAND THAT.</p>

            <p>I SWEAR ON MY LIFE THAT THESE ACCUSATIONS DID NOT COME PURPOSELY FROM ME.</p>

            <p> I DID NOT WANT TO OR WISH TO ACCUSE YOU OF ANYTHING.</p>

            <p>I DID NOT WANT TO OR WISH TO BE MANIPULATIVE AND CONTROLLING TOWARDS YOU.</p>

            <p>BECAUSE OF MY DELUSIONS I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO FEEL LIKE AND BELIEVE THAT I WAS 100% RIGHT NO MATTER WHAT
                THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO HURT ME.</p>

            <p>I KNOW IT ISN'T TRUE- AND WHEN IT WAS HAPPENING, I COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN OR HAVE BEEN CERTAIN NO MATTER
                WHAT I DID.</p>

            <p class="bold">I AM NOT TRYING TO USE DELUSIONS AS AN EXCUSE FOR MY BEHAVIOR. </p>

            <p>I AM ONLY TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED- HOPING THAT I AM NOT</p>
            <p>BLAMED</p> <p>PERSONALLY AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY
                FOR ACTING A CERTAIN WAY DUE TO A MENTAL ILLNESS.</p>

            <p>I DON'T BLAME PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS FOR BEING SCARED OR ANXIOUS OF DOING SOMETHING.</p>

            <p>I DON'T BLAME DEPRESSED PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO GET OUT OF BED OR TO NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE
                MOTIVATION TO DO ANYTHING.</p>

            <p class="bold">I DON'T BLAME DELUSIONAL PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO TELL THAT THEY ARE DELUSIONAL OR BLAME
                THEM FOR BELIEVING SOMETHING NOT BASED IN REALITY. </p>

            <p>NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY TO TELL YOU THAT I WASN'T IN CONTROL OF MY THOUGHTS OR FEELINGS DURING THIS
                PERIOD OF TIME, I STILL FEEL LIKE I AM BEING BLAMED FOR HAVING THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS THAT HAD ME
                BELIEVING THAT YOU WERE MALICIOUS TOWARDS ME.</p>

            <p>NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I TRY TO TELL YOU THAT THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU SPECIFICALLY OR</p>
            <p>ANYTHING YOU ACTUALLY DID-</p>
            <p>I CAN NEVER GET IT ACROSS BECAUSE I AM NOT THE BEST WITH WORDS.</p>

            <p>I DON'T BLAME YOU OR ANYBODY FOR MY ACTIONS. I WISH I COULD SAY I WAS IN CONTROL SO I COULD BLAME MYSELF
                PERSONALLY FOR MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AND SUBSEQUENTLY MY ACTIONS AND WORDS.</p>

            <p>I DO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE NOBODY DID OR SAID WHAT I DID BUT ME IN THE END.</p>

            <p class="bold">THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TAKING RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCEPTING BLAME. </p>

            <p>I DO NOT ACCEPT BEING BLAMED FOR SOMETHING THAT I COULDN’T CONTROL.</p>

            <p>I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND.</p>

            <p class="bold">I COULDN'T WIN AGAINST DELUSIONS. </p>

            <p>Is it my fault that I am depressed? Is it my fault that I am anxious? Is it my fault that I used to be
                delusional? No? Is it my fault that these things overcame me even though I fought back and am still
                fighting? No? If these things aren't my fault and the thoughts and feelings that go with them aren't
                either, then what can I blame me for? Acting on them? Believing my feelings were valid? Believing I was
                right because I was deluded and had no choice? Being emotionally unprepared for all of everything due to
                lack of experience and a warped reality learned from my parents? WHAT CAN I BLAME MYSELF FOR? I have
                evaluated and dissected everything I said and determined why I said these things and I can't get myself
                to 100% completely blame myself for each and every one of them. I am not blaming anybody else but me so
                don't think that while reading this. I can only think to blame my brain chemistry and my younger
                immature self for everything. Again I am also not trying to avoid responsibility. I take full
                responsibility for everything because in the end it was nobody else but me. But I do believe there is a
                difference in: 1. Taking responsibility. 2. Accepting blame. So that's the question that I am so
                confused about ultimately. What CAN I blame myself for and what more can I learn from my words and
                actions that I haven't already? What am I missing? Why is there still blame and grudge pinned on me? Why
                am I still losing friends? What am I doing wrong NOW that has nothing to do with before?</p>

                more effectively treated now than ever, allowing me to further be who I really want to be- personality
                wise, at least.</p>
            <p>Label-wise, to the public eyes: I am a dropout who is sick in the head.</p>
            <p>Yes it is true, I dropped out of high school to recover and now I am recovering from that- trying to get
                my high school diploma.</p>
            <p>But that shit doesn't define me, and after all of this is behind me, it will only be nothing more than a
                joke. "Back when I was your age, I graduated in the top 3% of my class!" "Wow, really?" "...of the high
                school dropout prevention program I attended."</p>
            <p>And you know what? I will take pride in that because even if it isn't regarded as impressive, and even if
                it wasn't the top of my class- I fucking lived to tell the tale. Which is more important to me than
                earning a sheet of paper that in these times seem to measure one's worth (which is bullshit).</p>
            <p>Even if I don't somehow manage to get my diploma, that doesn't mean that people who have are better than
                me, or have more worth or potential worth. If Quinten Tarantino can manage to live a life viewed as
                "successful" after dropping out of high school, then why can't I?</p>
            <p>Anyways, I made this post to kind of regard this as "one year ago I was in a mental health hospital, now
                look where I am" in terms of mental health and mental illness. This post is mainly for me and for any
                new followers that missed the whole part of me kind of losing it bad.</p>
            <p>I have documentation on this blog and of notes on my phone of my thoughts as I was going through all of
                this. When I read them, it is probably the scariest thing I've ever seen. It feels like I was drugged or
                something and was drastically changed mentally, and everything I did while I was "tripping" or whatever
                (for the sake of this metaphor) was blurred in my memory, and I can't remember most of it clearly, and
                after I got out of it and the "drug" wore off, that I am now shocked and disturbed at all that I've
                thought and done. I have drawings and pictures that I did and I can't look at them for long because it
                is so terrifying.</p>
            <p>It is terrifying to think that some little imbalance of chemicals in your brain or something can cause
                you to legitimately believe and feel like people are trying to hurt you all of the time for no reason,
                and that these people were out to get you and torture you for no reason. All of this irrationality, even
                if observed from a rational perspective, could not be escaped no matter fucking what. I would not wish
                delusions onto anybody. Ever.</p>
            <p>Even now that I am no longer delusional, I am depressed from all of the things I've said to people I
                lashed out on and hurt and accused and depended on for happiness and sanity or help and all of the
                things I did to try to prove to everybody that I was sane and rational and was myself which hurt people
                even more. Just. Fuck everything about delusions.</p>
            <p>I've said it probably hundreds of times, but I am still sorry for everything to everyone I affected.</p>
            <p>This was supposed to be a positive post, but I've been writing it for over an hour and have been
                reflecting on my past and now am crying.</p>
            <p>Anyways yeah. I'm here. Alive, and somewhat well.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Miles away from what I used to be.</p>

            <p>(I am sorry in advance for this gratuitous amount of whining, and at the same time I am not because I am
                literally just venting my feelings.)</p>
            <p>I care about people who couldn't give a shit about me or don't bother talking to me. It isn't even that
                I don't talk to them. I do.</p>
            <p>I guess it's just people not giving me the attention I give to them in return. Which I shouldn't feel
                entitled to, and do not. It just would be nice, ya'know?</p>
            <p>I dunno sometimes I feel like there are people whom I respect greatly and care about that disregard me as
                being a person. I am a human being, hell yeah I've made mistakes but that doesn't mean black/white
                thinking like "he made a mistake therefore he is terrible and will always be" should happen. That is
                your fucking problem. Hell if anybody who read this that this applies to, they'd probably shame me for
                feeling like this and would disregard this as being a real valid feeling.</p>
            <p>You know what, I am done thinking that I make/made all of the mistakes. Other people made mistakes as
                well and the ones I've been saying sorry to haven't even considered apologizing to me as well for things
                that they did.</p>
            <p>I probably shouldn't have forgiven some of the people I have, and was guilted into forgiving.</p>
            <p>I remember when it felt like one of these people considered me a human being, and I almost cried because
                it had felt so long since. But they were probably just saying it to make themselves feel better because
                they did not keep it up. They just use me which is totally not cool. mhm.</p>
            <p>Oh and if you are reading this and think this is about you, it really probably isn't.</p>
            <p>Fuck I feel like I could really write a song right now I feel like nothing more than a novelty.</p>

            <p> After almost a whole year of medication adjustments and all of that jazz, I finally found my cocktail. I
                have learned a ridiculously large amount of things in the past year, but I will not bore you with that
                unless you would like to hear it. (pm me or something I guess.) </p>
            <p>But I'd like to share some really important things that I have learned in the last week.</p>
            <p>Okay, so.</p>
            <p>I pretty much lost my mind when I realized that I couldn't feel love or passion or anything really. I
                felt broken and frustrated, especially under the circumstances.</p>
            <p>I've learned that brain chemically, I have had a major lack of dopamine being produced.</p>
            <p>Dopamine basically lets you have emotions, or it causes emotional responses, that is. It also can highly
                affect your concentration levels, excitement, and just overall pleasure from everything.</p>
            <p>So I felt mute because I wasn't feeling any good emotions, just all of the negative ones, such as
                sadness, anger, frustration, and anxiety.</p>
            <p>I didn't know what was happening at the time and I was really quite ignorant towards mental illness and
                brain chemical stuff. I just thought I was broken.</p>
            <p>I didn't know how to fix myself, I just couldn't do it no matter what I did, and eventually I became
                desperate and found myself addicted to anything that would stop all of the negative feelings for even
                just a moment. I became dependent, basically.</p>
            <p>All of my life, really. I have had racing thoughts.</p>
            <p>To give you an idea of what racing thoughts are like, it is like you are home alone and then you hear a
                really weird sound that is pretty loud and it sounds like it came from inside. What is going through
                your mind? "What was that? Is it a burglar? Or maybe a raccoon? Maybe something fell? Nah, but what if
                it is a burglar? What do I do? Think think think... Okay, I will go out of my room with my phone in my
                hand and I am going to go check it out, prepared to call 911 if there is anything unusual."</p>
            <p>Now imagine thinking like that about everything, and I mean everything.</p>
            <p>Constant.</p>
            <p>Not very fun.</p>
            <p>I like to explain the thought efficiency with like "10% of racing thoughts are actually useful, while 75%
                of normal, non racing thoughts are useful."</p>
            <p>So it isn't like you are just thinking fast, there is a lot of clutter and ridiculousness, you need to go
                through 10 thoughts to get one useful one.</p>
            <p>Anyways, I think I have explained that pretty well.</p>
            <p>So, imagine having a crush on someone or just having someone in your life romantically. With normal
                thoughts you would think about them pretty often, right? But you can still go about your day normally
                without much disturbance.</p>
            <p>But with racing thoughts, the often turns into a majority of the 90% of useless or unwanted thoughts
                going through your head.</p>
            <p>Which basically means it is obsession. But you don't want to be thinking about them that much, and
                eventually you just don't want to think about them at all during your school day or whatever. It hinders
                most of your ability to focus and function normally because you get easily distracted and lose the 10%
                of useful thoughts.</p>
            <p>The 10% of the thoughts are "they are wonderful" or something of that nature. The mushy thoughts that
                make you blush and feel butterflies. (You don't even get the butterflies without dopamine.) Then, on the
                other side, the 90% of the thoughts going through your head are straight up obsessive. You really don't
                want to be thinking about these things because it feels sick and crazy. "What are they doing? Who are
                they talking to? Are they thinking about me? I hope so. What did they have for lunch? Were they
                satisfied? I hope so. I need them. I hope they need me too."</p>
            <p>Then you really start to lose any and all feelings for them as an actual independent person that you want
                to care about but cannot. Your thoughts manifest so quickly that eventually you start making up
                expectations and you fall in love with ideas, not the person. You care about your ideas and your
                expectations, while you believe you are caring about the person, but are really not at all.</p>
            <p>You go out and do "romantic" things, going out of your way to do things to make them happy, or really, to
                make you happy.</p>
            <p>Without the dopamine to let you do it naturally, the dependence and obsession becomes a straight up
                addiction.</p>
            <p>Most of this is subconscious and well, at least for me, I didn't see anything wrong with it. I was so
                twisted, and legitimately sick in the head.</p>
            <p>So what happens when your ideas don't result in your expectations?</p>
            <p>You get disappointed. You get sad. You just wanted to be happy, or not-sad.</p>
            <p>You expect the other person to do the same things for you as well and you also begin to expect it.</p>
            <p>But what if they don't do crazy things and "care" about you as much as you "care" about them?</p>
            <p>You feel betrayed.</p>
            <p>You become, well at least I became delusional.</p>
            <p>I believed that everything anybody I "cared" about was doing that didn't make me happy or not-sad was in
                fact, intended to make me feel bad and hurt me.</p>
            <p>Okay, I know what you must be thinking.</p>
            <p>What the fuck? That is so twisted.</p>
            <p>Yeah, I know. ._.</p>
            <p>Worst part is like</p>
            <p>Normal irrational thoughts, that you can recognize to be irrational. You tend to stop for a second and
                cross them out, and replace them with a rational or reasonable thought.</p>
            <p>Now, with delusions, you can recognize as much as you want or can that the thought or belief is
                irrational. But you cannot, and I mean cannot cross them out.</p>
            <p>Delusions + Racing thoughts basically is like having one person stand in front of an army by themselves,
                saying "stop"</p>
            <p>lmao</p>
            <p>Now at least for me, I was able to make that one person become like a fucking kaiju saying "stop" but it
                took seriously every ounce of energy I could muster up to do it, and I couldn't hold it for very long.
                It was just something I couldn't do. Basically, my delusions+ racing thoughts+obsession was
                near-unstoppable.</p>
            <p>The expectations I had (I guess I am going to stop removing myself from this and speak in the first
                person) became so needed that I would do anything to make it reality, even if that meant controlling and
                manipulating people to do things to make it happen. And even if I could make it happen, I ended up
                feeling horrible anyways. These expectations were so insane that they would never happen by themselves.
            </p>
            <p>I felt like I needed to be happy as though my life depended on it. I felt that if I gave up my desperate
                methods of pursuing happiness, that I would forever be broken, and would not be able to take it any
                more.</p>
            <p>It was torture. I wanted to survive, but I didn't want to hurt people that I cared about. Yes this was
                real care, it popped up every once in a while and only then did something feel right.</p>
            <p>So I felt like I couldn't help but hurt everybody with accusations of things that they were "trying" to
                do to hurt me. Because it all felt real and was my actual reality. Accusing people of doing things that
                they aren't doing is a big form of emotional abuse. So is attempting to manipulate and control them.</p>
            <p>This is the part that I beat the living fuck out of myself for.</p>
            <p>I hated myself for wanting to be happy, because it meant unhappiness to people I cared about.</p>
            <p>It got to the point where I was so unsure of things that were happening in my head, that I was asking
                people if they were doing things to hurt me. I just wanted to know, because I couldn't tell anymore. It
                was real, but it felt wrong.</p>
            <p>Even asking people these things hurt them. :[ </p>
            <p>I couldn't stop hurting everyone or hurting myself (emotionally) and eventually it got to the point where
                it became traumatic for me. Every time I hurt someone with my stupid thoughts, I had seriously insane
                panic attacks. I was on the floor crying, hyperventilating, almost passing out, and actually having
                seizures on several occasions. I was throwing up at the mere thought of what I did. I was having so much
                anxiety that every time anything happened, I became dissociated, which is an out of body experience, but
                a terrifying one. Dissociation is like sitting alone in a movie theater and all of the sudden, the main
                actor looks at the camera, and addresses you. You feel like you are watching a movie, but the POV of the
                camera is actually you. You feel so disconnected and everything feels unreal.</p>
            <p>I couldn't let anybody know what was happening to me because I didn't want them to blame themselves.</p>
            <p>The only way I figured I could stop hurting people was to let go.</p>
            <p>I just couldn't let go of everybody I cared about. I just couldn't and that is my biggest regret to this
                day.</p>
            <p>I wanted to let go because I knew that I was toxic to everyone. But I couldn't at the same time because I
                felt like my happiness and life were depending on them.</p>
            <p>I was spiraling out of control.</p>
            <p>I knew it was a matter of time before they all wanted nothing to do with me.</p>
            <p>I feel like this is a good place to end this post I guess. The rest of the story involves me trying to do
                self improvement, and doing really crazy things and eventually checking myself into a mental hospital
                due to intense suicidal thoughts.</p>
            <p>Feel free to ask me about any of this. This is my personal blog, anyways.</p>
            <p>Thank you for reading this huge wall of text. (gold star for u)</p>
            <p>Hopefully I portrayed what I wanted to. I really hope this all makes sense.</p>
            <p>and I would like to just say</p>
            <p>I am horribly sorry.</p>

            <p> like yo </p>
            <p>this is the most Neil-y I've felt in a whole year</p>
            <p>Today at my therapy session we figured out that I basically have huge abandonment issues, as well as
                letting things go.</p>

            <p>The therapist was talking about how children, growing up, will inherit some of their parent's issues and
                behaviors unintentionally.</p>

            <p>Like for my Dad, he is super clingy and he isn't happy unless he has all of his kids together doing
                something they enjoy, which is almost impossible due to the fact that we have a 14 year range in ages.
                He manipulates and guilt trips and does all sorts of things childlike to get what he wants, or he gets
                disappointed and sad. And he takes any feelings we have personally. It is a really shitty way to be.</p>

            <p>Sounds like me this past year.</p>

            <p>Once I noticed I was doing these things and not being Neil, I pretty much left my Dad and haven't lived
                at his house for about a year now. After he made fun of me for having panic attacks and laughing in my
                face after I said "Fuck you" and flipped him off. yeeeeeeeeeeah...</p>

            <p>So clingyness and not being able to let things go can originate from fear of abandonment or fear of a
                void.</p>

            <p>The delusions I had were basically all originating from fear of abandonment. Like I was terrified of
                friends leaving me or ignoring me or shunning me, and I was believing that it was happening. I saw signs
                of it happening that weren't based on reality (which I couldn't know at the time). I tried my best to
                stop it from happening, and in doing so basically made it happen.</p>

            <p>So yeah, after figuring out the roots of all of the shit that was happening, I dunno, I feel a lot less
                confused, frustrated, angry, and hating of myself.</p>

            <p>Don't get me wrong, I hate who I was.</p>

            <p>But I have been carrying that hate for who I was and how fucking horrible and shitty and nasty and toxic
                I was for a very, very, long time. I just couldn't forgive myself and even last night I was up crying
                and beating myself up because of who I was and I have been doing that everyday for almost an entire
                year.</p>

            <p>I just want to stop doing that. It is only hindering my ability to move forward and grow.</p>

            <p>I just got to *breaks out into song* LET IT GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>

            <p>LET IT GOOOOO</p>

            <p>so yeah. that has been my semi-nightly ramble of the night.</p>

            <p>fuck.</p>
            <p>I used to have at least 3 or 4 panic attacks per day with racing thoughts, delusions, dissociation,
                excessive, and I mean excessive amounts of crying and all sorts of stuff like that.</p>

            <p>I am so very grateful for all of the resources I have been able to use to get through all of that stuff.

            <p>I have the choice to not be like my Dad.</p>
            <p>I am angry at myself and how long I have let myself be influenced by my Dad, who happens to be all of
                those things that I listed.</p>
            <p>I am so fucking done being like any of that garbage.</p>
            <p>I have the ultimate choice of who I want to be.</p>
            <p>I am done letting that choice be influenced by my Dad.</p>
            <p>I don't care if we don't "bond" or share any interests</p>
            <p>Yeah I did have delusions that really brought out these traits, but the problem is, that I never fully
                got rid of them. I never tried to change, and I always blamed who I was on my mental illness.</p>
            <p>Which is fucking stupid??</p>
            <p>Yes, my delusions had me believing that everyone I cared about was actively trying to hurt me, and the
                emotions that go with that, but that is all that was out of my control. I still tried manipulating and
                controlling and obsessing and guilting and just fucking being horrible to everyone and that was all me.
                I was in control of that part, and I am not proud of that whatsoever.</p>
            <p>I am done being in the mindset of "it wasn't really me"</p>
            <p>Because I really had the choice to act how I did, ultimately.</p>
            <p>Even if it was hard for me to make a rational decision among all of the racing thoughts and
                irrationality, I still had the power.</p>
            <p>And I never used it.</p>
            <p>That is where my fault lies.</p>
            <p>Beating myself up over it isn't going to change anything at all.</p>
            <p>But learning from my own mistakes and actually putting into practice what I have learned and shaping
                myself into someone that I could be proud of.</p>
            <p>That is something I have the choice to do.</p>
            <p>I am pissed off at myself for hiding behind my mental illness, trying to avoid blame because of it.</p>
            <p>That is such a horrible thing to do, I have nothing to say for myself.</p>
            <p>I came to think out all of these things today while I couldn't get out of bed from being too depressed
                and down and self-pitying.</p>
            <p>I just questioned myself.</p>
            <p>Why?</p>
            <p>And I thought to myself, I am a fucking Viking. I have the strength and willpower to overcome this shit,
                I just haven't been trying to because making this big of a change and cutting off the sewage from my Dad
                is not an easy task.</p>
            <p>I am not even saying that I have really completed this task.</p>
            <p>I just decided that I am fucking done being someone who I despise.</p>
            <p>Now I must begin reconstructing myself and being someone that I really am proud of.</p>
            <p>(ow my eyebrows hurt I was seriously D:< the whole time)</p>
                    <p>Anyways, this all probably looks and seems all very cliche and sort of meaningless, but I don't
                        care, it is meaningful to me, and this is my goddamn blog.</p>

            <p>9 months, I have been beating myself up for</p>
            <p>beating myself down to the ground</p>
            <p>and I have spent all of this time wishing for a helping hand</p>

            <p>sometimes I think about it and say</p>

            <p>trying so hard to feel an equivalent amount of pain for my deeds</p>
            <p>I spent all of my time and my energy on doing so</p>
            <p>which I later realized would be better spent on reconstruction</p>

            <p>I have been so horrible for so long to have broken trust probably beyond repair</p>
            <p>I have avoided consequence and blame and everything of the sort for this whole period of time</p>
            <p>I thought that because I was delusional and acted on those delusions, in a horrible way, that it wasn't
                my fault for doing so.</p>
            <p>Well it really is</p>
            <p>I have come to realize this now.</p>
            <p>I didn't have to respond to believing everyone was going out of their way, doing little things to hurt
                me, by giving what I thought was a taste of their own medicine.</p>
            <p>I chose to step down to my imagined enemies' level, and responded to their manipulation and passive
                aggressiveness with manipulation and passive aggressiveness.</p>
            <p>I have learned so many things from that mistake.</p>
            <p>Fuck it, I will try to list everything, and I don't give a damn about how cliche it sounds. This post is
                for me, so I can calm down.</p>
            <p>I've learned that it isn't okay to be possessive, controlling, and overly and easily jealous to people.

            <p>I've learned that trying to make an exclusive, dependent, and "perfect" relationship with anybody is
                immature and wrong.</p>
            <p>I've learned those things from thinking about it and realizing how wrong doing stuff like that is, and
                also noticing it among the people at my group therapy.</p>
            <p>It tended to be based around obsession and idealism, some people who weren't exactly insecure? and some
                who were. But it all came down to immaturity and lack of experience, oh and warped fucking perceptions
                of how to care about someone. All of which I saw in myself. People obsessively "falling in love" with
                the idea of a person, throwing them up on a pedestal and giving the other person all of the pressure
                that comes with that.</p>
            <p>I have come so far to not even be able to understand myself and my thought processes behind that.</p>
            <p>Part of it was racing, irrational, and obsessive thoughts that were later linked to mental illness.</p>
            <p>But part of it, and most of it, was all me. I spent so much time thinking how amazing it would be to have
                someone in my life in such a way to have an elevated mutual caring for one another and I spent so much
                time frolicking in my imagination that it manifested- and tried to make my idea of "the perfect
                relationship" into reality.</p>
            <p>Which is insatiable and twisted, and just completely and utterly selfish.</p>
            <p>To disregard the actual person and project my idea onto them.</p>
            <p>and well, I am sorry if anybody feels uncomfortable reading this, this isn't necessarily directed towards
                anyone, this is actually how every single one of my relationships went down.</p>
            <p>I never learned from anything, and I've always thought that I learned a whole bunch and matured after
                every relationship, but I have always been ridiculously wrong.</p>
            <p>Anyways, other lessons that I have learned:</p>
            <p>I've learned how to love and accept people for who they are, which seems really basic, but this is coming
                from a past racist, anti-feminist, homophobic, transphobic, myopic trash.</p>
            <p>This was really a big deal for me, because I know how easy it seems almost?</p>
            <p>I am not going to excuse how I was, because I think it is inexcusable.</p>
            <p>Anyways, I have also realized that it is okay to have feelings for anyone?</p>
            <p>I mean, I look at some people and start thinking how interesting and amazing they are as a person, and I
                start developing crushes on a majority of them. But have always denied myself the privilege. I have
                always been taught how wrong it is and how nasty it is, but all of that is just super duper bullshit and
                I am starting to quiver again just thinking about it.</p>
            <p>Fuck that man.</p>
            <p>(Innuendo intended.)</p>
            <p>I wouldn't go as far as to say that I am bisexual or pansexual, because I am not that into most people.
                Or at least not yet.</p>
            <p>But I have decided, after having butterflies over some of my good friends, and just like being really
                confused, that I am panromantic.</p>
            <p>I would probably date any of my friends because I have made a lot of friends and love them for who they
                are and there are just so many amazing people in my life ahHH</p>
            <p>But I don't, and by this, I don't even mean that I am denying myself the thought, but I don't necessarily
                think about or want to uh. *get down* with any of them if ya know what I mean.</p>
            <p>Just think about holding their hands and doing cutesy things with them and it is really weird and
                confusing for me to some extent, but I am not so slowly embracing this new found part of me, and
                identifying myself as panromantic. :D</p>
            <p>okay okay okay</p>
            <p>uh</p>
            <p>more lessons</p>
            <p>ummm</p>
            <p>well these aren't all necessarily lessons as I thought they would be, mainly just things that I have
                learned?</p>
            <p>whatever</p>
            <p>I've learned how to trust people.</p>
            <p>Which is really big for me, because I have never really trusted people because that is probably one of
                the more difficult things to do.</p>
            <p>I have always initially lied and put up a superficial wall in between other people and I to avoid any
                pain, and that really just doesn't make sense.</p>
            <p>How can you expect trust and honesty and even respect if you don't give it?</p>
            <p>I can barely wrap my head around my past behavior in these regards.</p>
            <p>The funniest and most ironic thing I have so far, is that people who put on a show to be macho and
                "strong" are the weakest in terms of maturity and emotional growth. (Which explains how my Dad acts like
                a 7 year old most of the time.)</p>
            <p>I know this is basically common sense and there isn't groundbreaking revelations going on here. But I've
                always seen that and thought that on other people, with a double standard with my family and I..</p>
            <p>I mean, I am really glad that I learned all of this stuff from my mistakes and everything, and am aware
                of these things.</p>
            <p>A phrase I have been putting to use is, "Once awareness has been raised, it cannot be lowered." but I
                have mainly been using it as a joke after using people's warped logic against them and "blowing their
                mind" by showing how contradicting it is. It is all quite fun, but I digress.</p>
            <p>uhh let's see</p>
            <p>I have learned not to lie to myself and deny myself any negative emotion.</p>
            <p>This is really important, and I have been passing this on.</p>
            By suppressing negative emotions, and all of the ones you don't want, while it seems logical, is horribly
            counterproductive. Because while numbing yourself to those emotions, you also numb yourself to the emotions
            you DO want to feel.</p>

            <p>I know this is hard to make sense of and put logic behind.</p>

            <p>But there is one huge illogical thing that makes us human, which is emotions, in all shapes and forms.
            </p>

            <p>I've learned that the most logical thing to do with feelings is to let them happen.</p>

            <p>Let them pass, don't try to stop them.</p>

            <p>Stopping them is like stopping traffic, everything gets backed up and pretty undesirable. The hard
                working, good emotions are stuck behind all of the negative, nasty emotions, but cannot move their car
                forward without the other cars moving...etc I'm sure you get the point.</p>

            <p>So that is important. Because I have wanted so badly to feel emotions, to the point where I was crying,
                which is kind of funny if you think about it. But I wasn't able to, because of lack of trust in myself
                and the numbness and blockage of my "undesired" emotions.</p>

            <p>I can't stress that enough, well any of these enough. These things are important as heckie.</p>

            <p>Oh oh oh and I also learned something cool</p>

            <p>That even thinking about anything gives whatever you're thinking about power over you. Because thinking
                triggers emotions, which can control other thoughts and perhaps even actions.</p>

            <p>and like, all of the "anti-" stuff is somewhat counter productive because the more you think about war or
                drugs, or terrorism, the more emotions are caused by them, giving them more power, while you are trying
                to take away their power?</p>

            <p>So like Mother Teresa got this shit down. She wouldn't attend an "anti-war" gathering or demonstration,
                but would instead asked to attend a "peace" gathering or demonstration. Because you want to give power
                to the good things, instead of the bad, right?</p>

            <p>Makes a lot of sense.</p>

            <p>Oh and on that note, thinking about something and imagining that you already have it, to the point where
                you can feel emotion and power from the mere thought, makes it so you are much more aware and open to
                opportunities that arise to help you achieve or get whatever it is. People tend to call this the "law of
                attraction" which makes some sense, even if you don't completely believe in it. Basically by keepin it
                posi, and not saying like "oh that'll never happen" or "no way" doesn't achieve anything but limiting
                yourself to those thoughts and ideas.</p>

            <p>It is all pretty cool if you think about it.</p>

            <p>Anyways, it is 2:30 and I have been writing this for probably a half an hour or even a whole hour. I
                think I achieved what I wanted to achieve, which was to calm myself down. I did somewhat visibly so
                perhaps anybody who is reading this and got this far, would perhaps learn something? I dunno, it is hard
                to learn things that you haven't observed or experienced yourself.</p>

            <p>Anyways, goodnight.</p>

            <p>You are awesome.</p>

            </span>

        </div>

        <div class="diary">
            <p>these past few days have been really really weird for me</p>

            <p>I signed a makeshift contract that makes me go to school 100% every day until Jan. 31. If I do not
                comply, then I get put into all Virtual School classes, which I can't really see myself doing because I
                am almost 90% an auditory learner and well, with all of these videogames on my computer, I don't think I
                could not procrastinate a lot.</p>

            <p>So this all seems like a pretty bad deal on my end, but there was actually something good for me. They
                switched me out of my 7th period English class and put me into 4th period, so I could be in 7th period
                Web Design.</p>

            <p>Which is basically the unofficial second period of CTV.</p>

            <p>So I am back. B)</p>

            <p>Okay, so the problem for me going to school was I couldn't get out of bed until 12:30, because of this
                insane fog that I had when I woke up. I just got so down and just so fogged up that I would stare at the
                ceiling and not reply to anybody. I could look at the clock 20 times and not know what time it was. My
                Mom actually drove home from work once because I didn't answer her 17 phone calls, it didn't even
                register that someone was trying to reach me.</p>

            <p>It was really, really bad.</p>

            <p>(I got some medication adjusted accordingly)</p>

            <p>Then the other problem was transportation.

            <p>If I managed to get out of bed before my classes started, I usually had no way to get to school other
                than the public transit bus, which got me to school 30-40 mins late. Which I thought was a big deal from
                anxiety and the fact that I only had 3 classes at the time. I felt that I missed most of my day already.
                I dunno anxiety is not exactly rational most of the time.</p>

            <p>So yesterday, the day I signed the contract, I also had a family session at my mental health place thing
                for therapy. And we basically decided that I needed a way to get to school independently. So the initial
                idea was an electric scooter, but they feared that it would stand out too much and would more likely be
                stolen. So my parents decided that they would let me get an electric bike.</p>

            <p>Which is pretty darn sweet.</p>

            <p>But it costs a lot of money, and my Mom was thinking that it would also be a good investment towards
                college or whatever, so we found the cheapest most inconspicuous bike that we could find, and I am
                probably going to get it this weekend.</p>

            <p>But on the way to the Electric Bike Store, my Dad kept making jokes and saying really really racist,
                homophobic, transphobic, and sexist things.</p>

            <p>I can't explain how confusing it was for me, because I felt disgusted with my own father, and lost a lot
                of respect for him. And I realized that the things he was telling me, were the same things he has been
                telling me my whole life, and I finally realized how nasty it all is.</p>

            <p>He said "this is a man's store" when we went to a tool store? He kept going on how manly it was and how
                much it was for men only. Like what and why? There were women in the store, and there was a girl working
                there, who probably knows more about tools and "manly" things than my Dad does.</p>

            <p>He then *warned* me about a certain area in Miami, calling it the "Rainbow Flag area" that "You just need
                to look out for and be careful where you are" and my first thought was, "fuck. how the hell am I going
                to tell my dad that I am panromantic?" "he is not going to understand at all and will make fun of me
                like he made fun of my "anxiety attacks" fuck." and then I just kept thinking how horrible what he was
                saying was and I also felt a weird haunting feeling from my past self, similar to nostalgia, but
                negative. Like, I used to believe this shit? Fuck who I was. Actually don't, he was a terrible asshole.
            </p>

            <p>He then talked about how when he was in College, he went to a "Gay bar", knowing it was such, and saw "a
                lot of really pretty girls" that he was too scared to talk to them fearing that "they might not be
                girls, if you know what I mean"</p>

            <p>At this point, I just felt so unbelievably uncomfortable, sitting in my Dad's huge pickup truck,
                listening to country, having him try to connect with me in a very disgusting way. I felt sick, I really
                did. I felt scared and anxious and I wanted to be very far from him.</p>

            <p>I also realized that my Dad is very very manipulative and controlling.</p>

            <p>He wanted to also take me to dinner, but I said "no, it is pretty late and I need to take my meds." I
                just wanted to get away from him. And he put on this horrible guilting and childish voice "oh come on.
                have dinner with your daddy" and made all of these sad noises and this is about when I became
                dissociated. I tend to do that whenever I want to leave a situation but cannot, it is stress and anxiety
                related. I just didn't know how to reply.</p>

            <p>Just fuck everything about that. If you're so macho that you go to tool stores and ironically buy little
                versions of yourself, and can talk in super racist "ebonics" and go on about how you are scared to
                approach people because you don't know what gender or sex they are, and are scared of a flag with a
                rainbow on it, then shouldn't you be able to "handle" being rejected by your son? Fuck that.</p>

            <p>How the hell am I going to tell my Dad that I have a crush on my friend Jesus, who is also panromantic?
                He won't even be able to comprehend that you are allowed to have feelings. period. about anything or
                anybody, that the one thing that makes you really human are the illogical emotions that we cannot
                explain most of the time.</p>

            <p>How do you go about not allowing yourself to have certain emotions?</p>

            <p>Fuck.</p>

            <p>That is something that took me a very, very long time to learn.</p>

            <p>I am pissed off at my Dad, and don't excuse myself for not speaking up against his hateful and terrible
                words.</p>

            <p> I need this to stop, or I am really not going to have my Dad in my life.</p>

            <p>Hell, I haven't been living at his house for almost a year now, and I've realized that that place is an
                emotional prison.

            <p>You can't be interested in "girly" stuff if you are a boy, and you cannot be interested in "boyish" stuff
                if you are a girl. And videogames will actually rot your brains out, and you shouldn't even look at
                them. Never mind the fact that you are curious and the hypocrite of a step-mom that I have who promotes
                "science, nature, and good health", will lie to her own children to keep their minds closed and to
                suppress their childlike curiosity towards a wonderful art form. I just can't comprehend it. Science is
                about the opening of minds, not the closing, it is human nature to be curious, and it is unhealthy to
                deny yourself feelings or interests, because all of this really fucks with and suppresses your
                personality.</p>

            <p> I am used as a bad example to my 6 and 7 year old siblings. I am both proud and unhappy about that. I am
                proud because I want don't want to be someone that my Step-mom or my Dad thinks is "normal" and "good"
                and unhappy because I cannot stop the closing of my siblings' minds. I've really really tried, and I can
                read that they want, but feel forbidden. They repeat my step-mom's words, word for word, and believe it,
                and tell it to their friends and just fuck that.</p>

            <p>I refuse to pretend any longer.</p>

            <p>I just feel so betrayed and sickened by all of this and I am really quite sad now actually.</p>

            <p>I guess that's enough ranting for tonight.</p>

            <p>Have a nice evening ^.^</p>

            </span>

        </div>

        <div class="diary">
            <p>I find myself feeling like an old wise man at my group therapy sessions for adolescents, and even in some
                of the adult groups.</p>

            <p> People trying to apply logic to emotions, and reason with them, and people who are obsessed and people
                who are anxious and paranoid and well, people who are really, quite like me.</p>

            <p> People who live for other people instead of themselves is a big one.</p>

            <p> And there are a lot of people who think good self-esteem and arrogance are the same thing.</p>

            <p> I have really really been all of these things.</p>

            Mostly really obsessive, though.</p>

            <p> It comes with racing thoughts. For me at least.</p>

            <p> I really don't want to be obsessed, it happens over people and things, mainly people, and well I wish a
                lot that I could stop it. I don't want to think about people or things or anything to the point where it
                is disrupting my life, and I really just want to leave it all alone. The racing, irrational, obsessive
                thoughts are slowly creeping back and I am not giving into their impulses, the best I can, but I know I
                can do better. I will do better. Because I don't want to be obsessed, I want to care.</p>

            <p> Another thing is,</p>

            <p> I thought caring meant giving up everything to care for someone.</p>

            <p> I was inadvertently really selfish because I always expected the same in return.</p>

            <p> Friends, family, SOs.</p>

            <p> It happened with everything really. It is really unfair and unhealthy to rely on someone or something
                else to make up for everything given up. Relying on someone or something else to provide happiness for
                me, is not the way to do it.</p>

            <p> I needed to make myself happy, and be completely emotionally independent, and I have accomplished that
                for the most part, and only for the most part because I did it for the wrong reasons.</p>

            <p>Again, I did it for someone other than me, and that is wrong.</p>

            <p> I have been living for other people instead of myself, just like the other people in my group sessions.
            </p>

            <p> I have been doing it for so long that I can hardly even remember when I started to do that.</p>

            <p>And that was a really big thing for me to learn.</p>

            <p>I've learned how to trust and love myself, and with it, others.</p>

            <p> I've learned that people don't need a "savior" and that I should not try to be one for them. It is
                really unhealthy and twisted.</p>

            <p>I've learned how to trust in other people's emotional independence, that they don't need me to be happy.
            </p>

            <p>I've learned that not everyone thinks and feels the same way I do, or did.</p>

            <p>I've learned a lot of things, and hopefully I have grown, because I am pretty proud of who I am now, but
                not to the point where I am satisfied. I want to keep improving to keep up and grow and be the best
                person I can be at all times.</p>

            I have so much more to learn and I am no longer scared to attend life.</p>

        <div class="diary">
            <p> I'm bAAAAAAAAaaaaaack </p>

            <p> I want to major in Film and at that place it is like you start off by taking core classes.Then you
                have a shit ton of time in classes 5 days a week and you fucking get your Bachelor's degree in 2 years-
                but you don't have any breaks at all really.</p>

            <p> It is basically like working a full time job or an internship.</p>

            <p> I am going to think about going to this place I guess. o.o</p>

            <p> It is a private school but they didn't try like really really hard selling the college during the tour.
                It was basically like "yo dis is wut we gots." and it was mainly technical and information only. No
                nonsense-to-get-ur-moni bullshit (but they were still obviously trying to get our moni).</p>

            <p> The only part that was almost there was the President of the school like gave a really pathos-filled
                speech, but other than that- pretty straightforward.</p>

            <p> I just don't know if I want to or like *can* *do that.* I am finally on the right cocktail of meds and
                haven't had a freak out for like a whole 2 months. I have had some big-ish panic things but that only
                really happened at night when most of my meds weren't much in my system anymore. (Doctor changed the
                timing of most of the meds to help me with that.)</p>

            <p> I don't have panic attacks twice or even once a day anymore. I just really am getting used to being like
                normally stable again(who the fuck is completely stable?) and I want to make sure that this is a
                consistent thing like it has been all month.</p>

            <p> I don't want to sign up for a super fucking intense film program if I am not able to handle it like I
                couldn't handle marching band. (having pretty big panic attacks everyday out of fucking nowhere)</p>

            <p> Also the school hooks you up with internships and jobs right after you graduate. Which is really key in
                the film/media industry (Apparently they have a shit ton of contacts and stuff. Oh and they also
                apparently have the biggest backlot for a school in America, which seems believable because literally
                the whole back of the campus is a backlot. Anyways...)</p>

            <p> They also have like collaborations between majors and stuff. Like the Recording Arts majors would help
                out the film majors in doing the soundtrack and the art design majors would design art for sets and
                stuff. Film majors would help out the Video Game Development majors in like cinematics and cool stuff.
            </p>

            <p> It is just really interesting I guess</p>

            <p> I am a little bit excited because I have a huge passion for films and videogames. If you get me started
                I will nerd all over you in technical stuff and overwhelm you in film jibber jabber.</p>

            <p> I dunno, I have always kind of suppressed my inner nerd and showing off my passion for film around most
                people because I know what it is like to be on the other end, not understanding any of it.</p>

            <p> Well whatever, if you don't like me being passionate about film and stuff then ~~get out of my face~~
                that's okay I guess. Just tell me if I go overboard.</p>

            <p> enough for me to piss my pants ((not really but almost) there were very few bathroom breaks)</p>

            <p> I'm used to operating a dingy little jib that has makeshift weights on the other end and using a Rock
                Band mic to record music and sometimes Voice Overs</p>

            <p> They have fucking everything</p>

            <p> the editing suites were like yo</p>

            <p> the soundstages were like yo</p>

            <p> the everything was like yo</p>

            <p> (I guess I am a little bit excited...)</p>

            <p> fuggen heck yo</p>

            <p> My mom said if it wasn't for the meds, I'd probably be in a hospital right now.</p>

            <p> It is just really scary to think about and I keep having dreams about it and it makes me really uneasy.
            </p>

            <p> I barely recognize myself thinking back, and there feels like a pretty huge part of my past year that I
                can barely remember whatsoever. D:</p>

            <p> I mean I never really thought about it, but as I'm typing this, I think I was traumatized by everything
                that went down.</p>

            <p> I seriously cannot remember most of it now. O.O</p>

            <p> That is really fucking scary actually.  O.O</p>

            <p> shit I forgot where I was going with this</p>

            <p> I guess I made this post because I am attempting to compare myself now to my past self and I can barely
                remember anything</p>

            <p> I know I was racist, sexist, anti-feminist, complete patriarchy supporter, overall ignorant asshole.</p>

            <p> Somewhere along the line since then I just kind of was like yo</p>

            <p> I don't like being this way</p>

            <p> this doesn't feel right</p>

            <p> this doesn't feel like me</p>

            <p> so I decided to change my ways and shit</p>

            <p> now I'm feminist, anti-racist, completely color blind, patriarchy demolitionist, and am way less
                ignorant (as far as I know. heh) and I figured out that I am panromantic recently? I don't know but I
                have always had like minicrushes on most of my friends and I kind of just was like "no. bad."</p>

            <p> oh and another thing.</p>

            <p> I can *feel* emotions now.</p>
            <p>
                That is something different than before.</p>

            <p> I used to be completely disconnected from most of my emotions except fear, anger, frustration, sadness,
                and just pain.</p>

            <p> I guess that was part of the psychotic whatever stage</p>

            <p> but now I am full of feels and have like 3 crushes and now remember what it is like to have actual real
                feelings for people?</p>

            <p> er this is making me uneasy thinking about it</p>

            <p> but while I was like untreated and stuff I didn't have feelings or any kind of like connection? to
                people whatsoever.</p>

            <p> ok this is getting too creepy and I am pretty darn uneasy now I am going to go lay down. >~< </p>
